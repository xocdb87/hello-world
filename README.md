# hello-world
The time honored tradition when starting out on GitHub.

My name is Brian and I'm a 31 year-old male from Arizona. I have started my journey in learning to develop web sites, web apps and hopefully mobile apps as well. FreeCodeCamp is my weapon of choice at the moment. I am also continuing my education online for a Bachlor's in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I look forward to committing code and working on side projects in the near future.
